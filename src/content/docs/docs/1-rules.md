description: The rules for the Globe.pub community.

Welcome to Globe.pub! Visiting a new place can be intimidating, but itâ€™s always
easier when you have help from friends. My goal is to build a community where
travelers can give helpful advice, share their unique experiences, and learn
from each other.

My hope is for this community to support the curious adventurers out there. Help
us build a space together by following these rules:

1. **Be empathetic, welcoming, and open.** Weâ€™re all on the same team â€“Â we are a
   community of people who like to visit new places and have new opportunities.
   Be nice to other users! The Internet is more fun when weâ€™re working together,
   not arguing.
2. **No racism, sexism, fascism, transphobia, or bigotry.** Globe.pub is an
   inclusive community. Belittling or exclusionary behavior will not be
   tolerated.
3. **Respect other people and donâ€™t be a jerk.** If you're not sure if something
   is okay, ask yourself: "Would I say this to someone's face?" If the answer is
   no, then it's probably not okay to say it here.
4. **Mark content as NSFW.** This is generally a safe-for-work community, so if
   you post something thatâ€™s not safe for work, please mark it as NSFW using the
   checkbox. This helps other users keep it out of their feed.
5. **No spam or unsolicited promotion.** Please message the admins if youâ€™re not
   sure if your post counts as spam.

If you see a post that breaks the rules, use the `ðŸš©` button to **report the
post** in Lemmy and they'll be sent to admins to handle. For any other issues,
email admin [@mplewis](https://lemmy.globe.pub/u/mplewis) at
[matt@globe.pub](mailto:matt@globe.pub).
